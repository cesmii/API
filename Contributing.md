# Contributing

Contributions to this project from the community are welcome -- but please do not start with a Pull Request.
In the spirit of collaboration and consensus-driven evolution, changes to the project should follow these steps:

1. [Read the RFC](https://github.com/cesmii/API/blob/main/RFC%20for%20Contextualized%20Manufacturing%20Information%20API.md) in detail to ensure your proposed changes are within the spirit and intent of this effort.
2. [Review existing Issues](https://github.com/cesmii/API/issues), both open and closed, to ensure your ideas have not already been addressed or discussed.
3. [Create a New Issue](https://github.com/cesmii/API/issues/new/choose) describing your proposed changes. The Working Group triages issues twice a month.
4. If you intend to submit a Pull Request related to the issue, tag the issue with [server-proto](https://github.com/cesmii/API/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aserver-proto).
5. Once triaged, the issue will be moved to the Todo column in the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/cesmii/projects/1) as a signal to begin work.
6. Fork the [prototypes](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/prototypes) branch to your GitHub account, and make any proposed changes related to the issue in your own fork.
7. When you are ready, submit a Pull Request back to the [prototypes](https://github.com/cesmii/API/tree/prototypes) branch, and update your issue indicating readiness for Review.
8. The Working Group will review your PR during a regular meeting, and provide feedback or merge your change, as appropriate.
9. The Working Group may chose, at its discretion, to invite you or your team to an occurence of the regular meeting to represent your changes. 
If you want to be a part of that review, please indicate your preference in your issue.

Please note we have a charter and code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Code Quality Standards

1. This is an all volunteer effort, we are not expecting perfection -- we are expecting functional code.
2. Most of us are using AI-assisted development to save time. This is acceptable and even encouraged, as long as it remains aligned.
3. Other members of your organization may contribute to your Pull Request, but we ask that only one individual acts as representative for each organization.
4. Regardless of who, or how, code is generated, Pull Requests that do not compile, or that crash at run-time, including crashes to other functionality as a result of your changes, will be rejected.
5. Where appropriate, include tests or updates to the test Client, to validate that your contribution works.

## Charter

Please review the [working group charter](Working Group Charter.md) and ensure you can agree to its conditions.
If you are a part of an organization, your participation in this project commits your organization to the
charter as well.
